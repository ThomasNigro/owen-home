							<p>Because I've been in the trenches, I know all about the tech that matters, like Node.JS, PHP, Heroku, AWS, GCP and more. That positions me perfectly to build both marketing and technical strategy for growth.</p>
							<p>Today, I run my own business and help great teams get to their potential. I work with product teams to help build the UX writing discipline, and with startups on taking their brand to the world.</p>

			<h5>What</h5>
			<p>I run my own business. It started with Charged in 2013, a weekly newsletter delivered to 15,000 people.</p><p>Today, it's also a paid daily service with 400 members and I deliver it Tuesday - Friday mornings.</p>

		<div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4">
		<h5>Where</h5>
			<p>Right now, I live in <strong class="font-weight-bold">Amsterdam, Netherlands</strong> with <a href="https://femke.co.nz">my partner</a> and our fluffy scottish-straight <a href="https://instagram.com/mikastgram">cat</a>, since 2015.</p>
			<p>I spent the better part of my life in Wellington, New Zealand, one of my favorite places in the world. We invented the flat white there.</p>

		<div class="col-md-4 col-lg-4">
			<h5>Weird</h5>
			<p>When I'm not working, I love to read and go on increasingly ridiculous hikes or road trips. I'm a little obsessed with finding new music, too.</p>
			<p>I'm an avid Twitter user, and joined the service in 2008. I didn't get my short username until much later, but that's a story for in person.</p>
