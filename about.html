					<p>I'm a technologist with experience wearing different hats, as a writer, developer, infrastructure engineer and marketer. Over the years I've crafted a unique ability to build my own products and communicate technically difficult topics across skill levels.</p>
					<p>In my spare time, I'm obsessed with learning new things, experimenting, and building products.</p>
